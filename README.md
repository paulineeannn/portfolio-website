## Personal Website
Hello, world! 👋🌍 This repository contains the code and assets for my portfolio, showcasing my skills, education, experience, and programming projects.

This portfolio signifies my first journey into the world of web development! 🎉 It's the first completed project I've built entirely from scratch, utilizing HTML, CSS, and JS. I'm thrilled to share it as part of my journey as a 3rd-year computer science student.

Feel free to explore the code and suggest any improvements you think would make it even better. Your feedback matters to me! 🥰💙
